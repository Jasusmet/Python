<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

<b>Yes, Python is case-sensitive.</b> This means that it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. For example, `myVariable` and `myvariable` are considered two distinct variables in Python.

</details>

### 03 - Is Python an interpreted language?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

<b>Yes, Python is an interpreted language.</b> This means that the code is executed line by line, without the need for a compilation step. This can make it easier to develop and test code, but it can also result in slower execution compared to compiled languages.

</details>

### 04 - What is slicing in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

Slicing is a powerful technique used to extract a specific portion of a sequence data type, such as a string, list, or tuple. It involves specifying a range of indices using square brackets, where the indices start from 0.

#### Basic syntax:

```py
sequence[start:stop:step]
```

- start: The index of the first element to include (default is 0)
- stop: The index of the first element to exclude (default is the length of the sequence)
- step: The number of elements to skip between each element (default is 1)

#### Examples

#### String slicing:

```py
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Extract the first 5 characters
first_5 = my_string[:5] # Output: "Hello"

# Extract characters from index 7 to 10 (inclusive)
substring = my_string[7:11] # Output: "World"

# Extract every other character
every_other = my_string[::2] # Output: "Hlo ol!"
```

#### List slicing:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Extract the first 3 elements
first_3 = my_list[:3] # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Extract elements from index 2 to 4 (inclusive)
sublist = my_list[2:5] # Output: [3, 4, 5]

# Reverse the list
reversed_list = my_list[::-1] # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

#### Tuple slicing:

```py
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Extract the last 3 elements
last_3 = my_tuple[-3:] # Output: (30, 40, 50)

# Extract elements from index 1 to 3 (inclusive)
subtuple = my_tuple[1:4] # Output: (20, 30, 40)
```

#### Key points:

- Negative indices can be used to count from the end of the sequence.
- If the start or stop index is omitted, the default is the beginning or end of the sequence, respectively.
- If the step is negative, the sequence is sliced in reverse order.

### 05 - How to delete a file from Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

To delete a file in Python, you can use the `os.remove()` functions fromt the `os` module. Here's how to use it:

```py
import os

file_path = "path/to/your/file.txt"

try:
  os.remove(file_path)
  print("File deleted successfully.")
except FileNotFoundError:
  print ("File not found".)
```

Replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path to the file you want to delete.

</details>

### 06 - What are built-in data types in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

Python provides several built-in data types that can be used to store different kinds of values. Here's a breakdown of the most common ones:

#### Numerical data types

- int: Represents integers (10, -5, 0)
- float: Represents floating-point numbers (3.14, -2,5)
- complex: Represents complex numbers (2+3j)

#### Sequence data types

- list: Ordered collection of items, allowing duplicates.
- tuple: Ordered, immutable collection of items.
- range: Sequence of numbers.
- str: Sequence of characters.

#### Mapping data type

- dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.

#### Set data types

- set: Unordered collection of unique items.
- frozenset: Immutable set.

#### Boolean data type

- bool: Represents True or False values.

#### None data type

- None: Represents the absence of a value.

#### Example:

```py
# Creating variables of different data types
x = 10 # int
y = 3.14 # float
z = 2+3j # complex

my_list = [1, 2, 3] # list
my_tuple = (4, 5, 6) # tuple
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30} # dict
my_set = {7, 8, 9} # set

# Printing the data types
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
print(type(my_list))
print(type(my_tuple))
print(type(my_dict))
print(type(my_set))
```

This code will output the data types of each variable.

</details>

### 07 - What's the difference between tuples and lists in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, tuples and lists are both used to store collections of elements. However, they have some key differences:

#### Tuples:

- Immutable: Once created, tuples cannot be modified. This means you cannot add, remove or change elements in a tuple.

- Enclosed in parentheses: Tuples are defined using parentheses, e.g., `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.

- Used for:

  - Storing fixed collections of elementes that won't change.

  - Returning multiple values from a function.

  - Creating keys for dictionaries.

#### Lists:

- Mutable: Lists can be modified after creation. You can add, remove or change elements using various methods.

- Enclosed in square brackets: Lists are defined using square brackets. e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.

- Used for:

  - Storing collections of elements that may change over time.

  - Performing operations like sorting, filtering and appending.
  </details>

### 08 - What's the difference between pass by value and pass by reference?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, arguments are passed to functions by reference, not by value. This means that when you pass a variable to a function, the function receives a reference to the object that the variable is pointing to. If the function modifies the object, the changes will be visible outside the function as well.

#### Pass by value:

- A copy of the variable's value is passed to the function.

- Any modifications made inside the function do not affect the original variable.

- Typically used for primitive data types like numbers and strings.

#### Pass by reference:

- A reference to the variable's object is passed to the function.

- Modifications made inside the function affect the original object.

- Typically used for complex data types like lists, dictionaries, and objects.

#### Example:

```py
def modify_list(my_list):
    my_list.append(4)

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, `modify_list` receives a reference to the `my_list` object. When it appends the value 4, the original `my_list` is modified as well.

### 09 - What are pickling and unpickling?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

<b>Pickling and unpickling</b> are processes in Python that allow you to serialize and deserialize objects. This means converting Python objects into a byte stream (pickling) and then converting that byte stream back into the original Python objetct (unpickling).

<b>Pickling</b> is useful when you need to:

- Save an object's state: Store the object's data and attributes for later use.

- Transmit an object: Send the object over a network or store it in a file.

- Create a persistent object: Make the object available for use in different Python sessions.

<b>Unpickling</b> is used to:

- Restore an object's state: Recreate the original object from it's pickled representation.

- Load an object from a file or network: Retrieve the object and use it in your code.

#### How it works:

#### Pickling:

- The `pickle` module is used to serialize the object.

- The object's data and attributes are converted into a byte stream.

- The byte stream can be written to a file or transmitted over a network.

#### Unpickling:

- The `pickle` module is used to deserialize the byte stream.

- The original object is reconstructed from the byte stream.

#### Example:

```py
import pickle

# Create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello"]

# Pickle the list
with open("my_list.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(my_list, f)

# Unpickle the list
with open("my_list.pkl", "rb") as f:
    unpickled_list = pickle.load(f)

print(unpickled_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 'hello']
```

#### Important considerations:

- Security: Pickling can be a security risk if you unpickle untrusted data, as it can potentially execute malicious code. Be cautious when unpickling data from unknown sources.

- Compatibility: Pickling can be sensitive to changes in the object's structure or the version of Python used. Ensure compatibility when using pickled data.

- Alternatives: While pickling is a convenient way to serialize objects, there are other options available, such as _JSON_ and _msgpack_, which may be more suitable for certain use cases.

</details>

### 05 - What are help() and dir() functions?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, `help()` and `dir()` are two built-in functions that provide useful information about modules, functions and variables.

#### Help() function

The `hellp()` function is used to display the documentation of a module, function or variable. It's a quick way to get help on a specific topic or to learn more about a particular function or module.

#### Syntax

The syntax for `help()` is `help(object)`, where `object` is the module, function or variable you want to get help on, here's an example:

```py
help(len)
```

This will display the documentation for the `len()` function, including it's syntax, parameters and return value.

#### Dir() function

The `dir()` function is used to list the names of variables, functions and modules in the current scope or in a specific module.

#### Syntax

The syntax for `dir()` is `dir(object)`, where `object` is the module or object you want to list the names for. If no object is specified, `dirc()` lists the names in the current scope, here's an example:

```py
import math
print(dir(math))
```

This will list the names of variables, functions and modules in the `math` module, including `sin`, `cos`, `tan` and others.

#### Use cases

`help()` and `dir()` are useful in a variety of scenarios, such as:

- Learning about a new module or function: Use `help()` to get detailed documentation on a specific topic.

- Exploring a module or package: Use `dir()` to list the names of variables, functions and modules in a module or package.

- Debugging: Use `dir()` to check the names of variables and functions in the current scope to identify potential issues.

</details>

### 06 What are namespaces in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

A namespace is used for creating unique object names that will not cause a conflic later, some namespaces are:

- local name space: Is temporaly created for a functional call and as soon as the call returns, it is cleared

- global namespace: Contains names from modules and packages

- built-in namespace: Includes names and functions of core Python (`len`, `type` or `True`)

#### How to acces namespaces

You can access namespaces using the dot notation. For example, if you have a module called `math` with a function called `sin`, you can access it using `math.sin`. Similarly, if you have a package called `mypackage` with a module called `mymodule`, you can access it using `mypackage.mymodule`.

</details>

### 07 - What are decorators in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

A decorator is a special type of function that can modify or extend the behavior of another function, is a small function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that "wraps" the original function. The new function produced by the decorator is then called instead of the original function when it's invoked.

#### Syntax

The syntax for a decorator ir `@decorator_name` followed by the function definition, for example:

```py
@my_decorator
def my_function():
  pass
```

This is equivalent to:

```py
def my_function():
  pass
my_function = my_decorator(my_function)
```

#### How decorators work

When you apply a decorator to a function, it's called with the function as an argument. The decorator returns a new function that "wraps" the original function. The new function is then assigned to the original function name.

Here's an example of a simple decorator that logs the execution time of a function:

```py
import time

def timer_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds to execute")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def my_function():
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Hello, world!")

my_function()
```

In this example, the `timer_decorator` function takes `my_function` as an argument and returns a new function `wrapper`. The `wrapper` function calls the original `my_function` and logs the execution time.

#### Use cases

Decorators are useful in a variety of scenarios, such as:

- Logging: Logging the execution time or other metrics of a function

- Authentication: Checking if a user is authenticated before allowing them to call a function

- Error handling: Catching and handling exceptions raised by a function

- Caching: Caching the results of a function to avoid redundant computations

- AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming): Implementing aspects such as logging, security or caching that cut across multiple functions

### 08 - How to use self in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, `self` is a conventionally used name for the first parameter of a method in a class. It's a reference to the instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods from the class.

#### What is self?

`self` is a reference to the instance of the class, similar to `this` in other programming languages. It's used to access variables and methods from the class and is passed ass the first parameter to methods in the class.

#### How to use self

Here's an example of how to use `self` in a class:

```py
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")

person = Person("John", 30)
person.greet()
```

In this example, `self` is used to access the `name` and `age` variables from the `Person` class and to call the `greet` method.

### 09 - How are .py and .pyc files different?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, `.py` and `.pyc` files serve different purposes in the development and execution of Python programs.

#### .py files

`.py` files are the source code files written in Python. They contain the original code written by the developer, including comments, functions, classes and other elements. These files are human-readable and can be edited using any text editor or IDE.

#### .pyc files

`.pyc` files, on the other hand, are compiled Python files. They contain the bytecode that is generated by the Python compiler from the `.py` source code files. These files are platform-independent and can be executed by the Python interpreter.

</details>

### 10 - What is the use of with in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, the `with` statement is a syntax construct that allows you to perform a block of code within a context manager. It's a way to ensure that resources, such as files, connections or locks are properly acquired and released, even if an exception is thrown.

#### What is a context manager?

A context manager is an object that defines the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. These methods are called when the `with` statement is executed. The `__enter__` method is called when entering the `with` block, and the `__exit__` method is called when exiting the block.

#### How the `with` statement works

Here's an example of using the `with` statement to open a file:

```py
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
  content = file.read()
  print(content)
```

When the `with` statement is executed:

1. The `open` function returns a file object, which is a context manager.

2. The `__enter__` method is called, which opens the file and returns the file object.

3. The code within the `with` block is executed.

4. When the block is exited, the `__exit__` method is called, which closes the file.

## Senior Python Developer Interview Questions

### 01 - What is monkey-patching?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, monkey-patching is a technique that allows you to dynamically modify or extend the behavior of a module, class or object at runtime. This is done by adding, modifying or replacing attributes, methods or functions of an existing module, class or object.

#### How monkey-patching works

Monkey-patching involves modifying the internal state of an object or module without changing it's external interface. This is achieved by assigning new values to existing attributes or by adding new attributes to an object or module.

Here's an example of monkey-patching a module:

```py
import math

def custom_sin(x):
  return x ** 2

math.sin = custom_sin

print(math.sin(2)) # Output: 4
```

In this example, we've monkey-patched the `math` module by replacing the original `sin` function with our own custom implementation.

</details>

### 02 - What is type conversion in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, type conversion is the process of changing the data type of a value from one type to another. This is also known as type casting or coercion. Type conversion is necessary when you need to perform operations on values of different data types or when you need to store values of different data types in a single variable.

#### Types of type conversion

There are two types of type conversion in Python:

- Implicit type conversion: This type of conversion occurs automatically when you perform operations on values of different data types. For example, when you add an integer and a float, Python automatically converts the integer to a float.

- Explicit type conversion: This type of conversion occurs when you use a function or operator to explicitly convert a value from one type to another. For example, you can use the `int()` function to conver a float to an integer.

#### Built-in type conversion functions

Python provides several built-in functions for explicit type conversion:

- `int()`: Converts a value to an integer.

- `float()`: Converts a value to a float.

- `str()`: Converts a value to a string.

- `bool()`: Converts a value to a boolean.

- `complex()`: Converts a value to a complex number.

- `list()`: Converts a value to a list.

- `tuple()`: Converts a value to a tuple.

- `dict()`: Converts a value to a dictionary.

- `set()`: Converts a value to a set.

#### Examples of type conversion

Here are some examples of type conversion in Python:

```py
# Implicit type conversion
x = 5 + 3.5 # x is a float
print(x) # Output: 8.5

# Explicit type conversion
y = int(3.5) # y is an integer
print(y) # Output: 3

# Converting a string to an integer
z = int("123")
print(z) # Output: 123

# Converting a list to a tuple
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple) # Output: (1, 2, 3)
```

</details>

### 04 - How to achieve multithreading in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

Multithreading in Python allows your program to execute multiple threads or flows of execution concurrently, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of your application. Python provides several ways to achieve multithreading, including:

#### 1. Threading module

The `threading` module is a built-in Python module that provides a way to create and manage threads. You can create a thread by subclassing the `Thread` class and overriding the `run()` method.

Here's an example:

```py
import threading
import time

class MyThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, name):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.name = name

    def run(self):
        print(f"Thread {self.name} started")
        time.sleep(2)
        print(f"Thread {self.name} finished")

# Create and start two threads
thread1 = MyThread("Thread-1")
thread2 = MyThread("Thread-2")
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for both threads to finish
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
```

#### 2. ThreadPoolExecutor

The `concurrent.futures` module provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing threads using the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class. This class allows you to submit tasks to a pool of worker threads and retrieve the results.

Here's an example:

```py
import concurrent.futures
import time

def my_task(name):
  print(f"Task {name} started")
  time.sleep(2)
  print(f"Task {name} finished")
  return f"Result from {name}"

# Create a thread pool with 2 worker threads
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
  # Submit two tasks to the thread pool
  future1 = executor.submit(my_task, "Task-1")
  future2 = executor.submit(my_task, "Task-2")

  # Retrieve the results
  result1 = future1.result()
  result2 = future2.result()

  print(result1)
  print(result2)
```

#### 3. Multiprocessing module

While not exactly multithreading, the `multiprocessing` module provides a way to create multiple processes that can run concurrently, which can be useful for CPU-bound tasks.

Here's an example:

```py
import multiprocessing
import time

def my_task(name):
    print(f"Process {name} started")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Process {name} finished")
    return f"Result from {name}"

# Create two processes
process1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=my_task, args=("Process-1",))
process2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=my_task, args=("Process-2",))

# Start the processes
process1.start()
process2.start()

# Wait for both processes to finish
process1.join()
process2.join()
```

### 05 - How to remove whitespace from a string?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, you can remove whitespace from a string using several methods, here are a few approaches:

#### 1. `strip()` method

The `strip()` method removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string, you can use it like this:

```py
my_string = "   Hello, World!   "
clean_string = my_string.strip()
print(clean_string) # Output: "Hello, World!"
```

#### 2. `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` methods

The `lstrip()` method removes leading whitespace, while the `rstrip()` method removes trailing whitespace, you can use them like this:

```py
my_string = "   Hello, World!   "
clean_string = my_string.lstrip() # Remove leading whitespace
print(clean_string) # Output: "Hello, World!   "

clean_string = my_string.rstrip() # Remove trailing whitespace
print(clean_string) # Output: "   Hello, World!"
```

#### 3. `replace()` method

The `replace()` method replaces a specified character or substring with another character or substring, you can use it to remove whitespace by replacing it with an empty string:

```py
my_string = "   Hello, World!   "
clean_string = my_string.replace(" ", "")
print(clean_string) # Output: "Hello,World!"

#### 4. Regular expressions

You can also use regular expressions to remove whitespace from a string. The `re` module provides a way to work with regular expressions in Python:

```py
import re

my_string = "   Hello, World!   "
clean_string = re.sub(r"\s+", "", my_string)
print(clean_string) # Output: "Hello,World!"
```

### 06 - What is a negative index in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

In Python, a negative index is a way to access elements in a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) from the end of the sequence instead of the beginning.

When you use a negative index, Python counts from the end of the sequence, starting from -1. This means that:

- `-1` refers to the last element of the sequence

- `-2` refers to the second-to-last element of the sequence

- `-3` refers to the this-to-last element of the sequence

- And so on...

Here's an example:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(my_list[-1]) # Output: 5 (last element)
print(my_list[-2]) # Output: 4 (second-to-last element)
print(my_list[-3]) # Output: 3 (third-to-last element)
```

Negative indexing is useful when you need to access elements from the end of a sequence, especially when you don't know the exact length of the sequence.

  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

While Python is an excellent choice for data analysis, it's not without it's limitations and potential pitfalls, here are some of the common issues to be aware of:

#### Performance:

- Slow execution: Python is an interpreted language, which means it can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java.

- Memory consumption: Python's dynamic memory allocation can lead to memory issues, especially when working with large datasets.

#### Code quality and maintenance:

- Indentation-based syntax: Python's use of indentation to denote code blocks can lead to errors and make code maintenance challenging.

- Dynamic typing: Python's dynamic typing can make it difficult to catch type-related errors until runtime.

#### Libraries and dependencies:

- Dependency hell: Python's package management system, pip, can lead to version conflicts and dependency issues.

- Library inconsistencies: Different libraries may have different APIs, making it challenging to switch between them.

#### Security:

- Injection attacks: Python's dynamic nature makes it vulnerable to injection attacks, especially when working with user input.

- Data encryption: Python's built-in encryption libraries may not be sufficient for high-security applications.


#### Other issues:

- Multithreading: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the benefits of multithreading in certain scenarios.

- Error handling: Python's error handling mechanisms can be complex and require careful attention to detail.

### 10 - Does Python support multiple inheritance?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

Yes, Python supports multiple inheritance, which allows a class to inherit behavior from multiple parent classes. This is in contrast to languages like Java, which only support single inheritance.

#### How multiple inheritance works in Python:

In Python, a class can inherit from multiple parent classes by listing them in the class definition, separated by commas. For example:

```py
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("The animal makes a sound.")

class Mammal:
    def feed_young(self):
        print("The mammal feeds its young.")

class Dog(Animal, Mammal):
    def bark(self):
        print("The dog barks.")
```

In this example, the `Dog` class inherits from bot the `Animal` and `Mammal` classes.
