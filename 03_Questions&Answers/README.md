<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

  <b>Python is a versatile programming language used for a wide range of applications.</b> Here are some of it's common uses:

  - <b>Data Science and Machine Learning:</b> Python's readability and extensive libraries like *NumPy*, *Pandas*, and *Scikit-learn* make it a popular choice for data analysis, visualization and building machine learning models.

  - <b>Web Development:</b> Frameworks like *Django* and *Flask* provide a robust foundation for creating dynamic and scalable web applications.

  - <b>Scientific Computing:</b> Python is used in fields like physics, chemistry and biology for simulations, data analysis and numerical computations.

  - <b>Automation:</b> Python's scripting capabilities can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as file management, web scraping or system administration.

  - <b>Game Development:</b> Python can be used to create games, especially 2D games and prototypes, using libraries like *Pygame*.

  - <b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> Python's simplicity and powerful AI libraries like *TensorFlow* and *PyTorch* make it a popular choice for developing AI applications.

  In essence, Python's versatility, readability and extensive ecosystem of libraries make it a valuable tool for a wide variety of tasks in the tech industry and beyond.

### 02 - Is Python case-sensitive?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

  <b>Yes, Python is case-sensitive.</b> This means that it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. For example, `myVariable` and `myvariable` are considered two distinct variables in Python.
</details>

### 03 - Is Python an interpreted language?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

  <b>Yes, Python is an interpreted language.</b> This means that the code is executed line by line, without the need for a compilation step. This can make it easier to develop and test code, but it can also result in slower execution compared to compiled languages.

### 04 - What is slicing in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

  Slicing is a powerful technique used to extract a specific portion of a sequence data type, such as a string, list, or tuple. It involves specifying a range of indices using square brackets, where the indices start from 0.
  
  #### Basic syntax:

```py
sequence[start:stop:step]
```

- start: The index of the first element to include (default is 0)
- stop: The index of the first element to exclude (default is the length of the sequence)
- step: The number of elements to skip between each element (default is 1)

#### Examples

#### String slicing:

```py
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Extract the first 5 characters
first_5 = my_string[:5] # Output: "Hello"

# Extract characters from index 7 to 10 (inclusive)
substring = my_string[7:11] # Output: "World"

# Extract every other character
every_other = my_string[::2] # Output: "Hlo ol!"
```

#### List slicing:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Extract the first 3 elements
first_3 = my_list[:3] # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Extract elements from index 2 to 4 (inclusive)
sublist = my_list[2:5] # Output: [3, 4, 5]

# Reverse the list
reversed_list = my_list[::-1] # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

#### Tuple slicing:

```py
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Extract the last 3 elements
last_3 = my_tuple[-3:] # Output: (30, 40, 50)

# Extract elements from index 1 to 3 (inclusive)
subtuple = my_tuple[1:4] # Output: (20, 30, 40)
```

#### Key points:

- Negative indices can be used to count from the end of the sequence.
- If the start or stop index is omitted, the default is the beginning or end of the sequence, respectively.
- If the step is negative, the sequence is sliced in reverse order.

### 05 - How to delete a file from Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

To delete a file in Python, you can use the `os.remove()` functions fromt the `os` module. Here's how to use it:

```py
import os

file_path = "path/to/your/file.txt"

try:
  os.remove(file_path)
  print("File deleted successfully.")
except FileNotFoundError:
  print ("File not found".)
```

Replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path to the file you want to delete.

### 06 - What are built-in data types in Python?

<details>
  <summary><b>Show/Hide Answer</b></summary>
  <br>

  Python provides several built-in data types that can be used to store different kinds of values. Here's a breakdown of the most common ones:

#### Numerical data types

- int: Represents integers (10, -5, 0)
- float: Represents floating-point numbers (3.14, -2,5)
- complex: Represents complex numbers (2+3j)

#### Sequence data types

- list: Ordered collection of items, allowing duplicates.
- tuple: Ordered, immutable collection of items.
- range: Sequence of numbers.
- str: Sequence of characters.

#### Mapping data type

- dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.

#### Set data types

- set: Unordered collection of unique items.
- frozenset: Immutable set.

#### Boolean data type

- bool: Represents True or False values.

#### None data type

- None: Represents the absence of a value.

#### Example:

```py
# Creating variables of different data types
x = 10 # int
y = 3.14 # float
z = 2+3j # complex

my_list = [1, 2, 3] # list
my_tuple = (4, 5, 6) # tuple
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30} # dict
my_set = {7, 8, 9} # set

# Printing the data types
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
print(type(my_list))
print(type(my_tuple))
print(type(my_dict))
print(type(my_set))
```

This code will output the data types of each variable.
